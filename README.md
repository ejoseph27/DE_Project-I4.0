## Digital Engineering Project — IMPLEMENTATION OF COMMUNICATION PROTOCOLS IN INDUSTRY 4.0 LEARNING LABORATORY

## Abstract

In the present industrial ecosystem, the demand from customers is continuously changing. To meet these requirements, the logistics industry should adopt various end to end supply chain solutions. The goal is to achieve coordination and transparency in all material flow operations. This can be achieved by constantly modifying the factory layouts according to production requirements. The standalone and modular factory components can be used for implementing dynamic factory layouts efficiently. The communication between these factory modules also plays an important role in the production network.

In this project, completely standalone and modular factory components are developed, each with an independent controller. The factory layouts are developed with production, storage and dispatch areas. The control flow in the factory layout is developed by simulating a virtual model in Visual Components and realised as a physical layout implementing different communication protocols.
 
 
 ## Achievements

•	Successfully built and integrated different communication protocol such as UART, Bluetooth, LiFi, IR, nRF on modular factory layout to realize smart manufacturing. A virtual      model of the factory was simulated on Visual Components 4.0 software.

•	Learned embedded systems programming in C, concepts of digital twin and smart manufacturing.
