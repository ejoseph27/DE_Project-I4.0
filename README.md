Digital Engineering Project — Objective of the project was to implement different communication protocols in Industry 4.0 learning laboratory

•	Successfully built and integrated different communication protocol such as UART, Bluetooth, LiFi, IR, nRF on modular factory layout to realize smart manufacturing. A virtual model of the factory was simulated on Visual Components 4.0 software.
•	Learned embedded systems programming in C, concepts of digital twin and smart manufacturing.
